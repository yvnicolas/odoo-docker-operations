### Main objective

For development, test  or operation purposes, we want to launch quickly a new odoo server running in docker containers with access to sources


### preparation

cloning sources downloaded from github can be long. We need to have it done once for both OCB backports and odoo official sources   
Place where are stored initial git clones of all odoo related sources and from where sources will be copied to lauch a new server

So before anything do here

```
git clone https://github.com/odoo/odoo.git
git clone https://github.com/OCA/OCB.git
```

the 2 created directory are in git ignore
